# Planning  
(45 minutes)  
  
As a group, discuss the potential tasks youâ€™ve come up with.  

- Estimate the time and complexity of each potential task
  - may any tasks be broken down into multiple subtasks?
- Work out a prioritisation order for the tasks
  - taking into account a limited time to address any of them
