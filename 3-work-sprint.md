# 3. A work sprint  
(2.5 hours)  
  
Time for action!  We’re going to address some of these tasks ourselves, this afternoon.  

**Everyone should take a task to work on, preferably one originally written by someone else in the group.**  
  
Most of the Data School teaching material exists as text files in GitHub repositories 
([links](lesson-repo-list.md)) and thus 
can be easily edited by anyone, by making a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) to have your own copy. Forking on GitHub is very similar to what you saw previously with [Bitbucket](https://csiro-data-school.github.io/git-intro-23/09-collaborating/index.html).

Instructors can help with creating a fork of a lesson on GitHub, creating a local clone and 
understanding the files involved.  

Make sure you’ve checked out the correct branch\*, create a new branch for your own work and then…  
  
1. Make changes to file(s) to complete your task.  
2. Push the change back to your forked remote repository (origin).  
3. On GitHub, create a Pull Request that would merge your changes back to the base branch  
  -Use this Pull Request to describe the change you made and why  
  -Save the Pull Request, but don’t Merge it (we’ll review together later)  
4. If more time, start another task?  
  
  
\* Lessons using the [older Carpentries template](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/)
use a branch named '**gh-pages**', while lessons using the 
[newer Carpentries template](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench-template-md/) (and most
other repositories) use a '**main**' branch.
