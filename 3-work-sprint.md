# 3. A work sprint  
(2.5 hours)  
  
Time for action!  We’re going to address some of these tasks ourselves, this afternoon.  

**Everyone should take a task to work on, preferably one originally written by someone else in the group.**  
  
Most of the Data School teaching material exists as text files in GitHub repositories 
([links](lesson-repo-list.md)) and thus 
can be easily edited by anyone, by checking out a forked branch with Git.  

Instructors can help with creating a fork of a lesson on GitHub, creating a local clone and 
understanding the files involved.  

Make sure you’ve checked out the correct base branch (for most of the 
[Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) based lessons, the branch is ‘gh-pages’), 
then create a new branch for your work.  Then…  
  
1. Make changes to file(s) to complete your task.  
2. Push the change back to your forked remote repository (origin).  
3. On GitHub, create a Pull Request that would merge your changes back to base branch  
  -Use this Pull Request to describe the change you made and why  
  -Save the Pull Request, but don’t Merge it (we’ll review together later)  
4. If more time, start another task?
