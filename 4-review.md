# 4. Review  
(45 minutes)
  
As a group, discuss the work you’ve done and how it went. Talk through your Pull Requests 
and show your changes. Would the group approve the changes and mark the tasks as done, 
or suggest revisions?  

What worked? What didn't? If you were going to do this exercise again next week, would you make any changes?

If you’re happy with your improvements, you may like to formalise with real Pull Requests 
back to the original Data School repositories you forked from, for the maintainers to consider 
incorporating.
