# 1. Task identification  
(1.5 hours)  
  
Through the initial weeks of Data School, perhaps you noted some moments where you felt the 
teaching content could do with more polish?  Spend the next while revisiting the teaching notes 
of what you’ve covered so far ([links](lesson-list.md)).  While reminding yourself what you’ve 
learned, try to identify some improvements or fixes that you think could be made.  

**Write your suggestions down as to-do list style tasks on post-it notes.**  

- Suggestions can be as simple as a fixing a typo you spotted or as complex as rewriting a 
section to be clearer,
- But should be discrete and clearly described pieces of work. 
- Try to come up with at least 2 post-it tasks each.
